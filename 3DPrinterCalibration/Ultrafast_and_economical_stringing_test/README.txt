# Summary

There are already many calibration and test parts to get rid of the stringing of your printer, but this one is optimized so that you can print it quickly to achieve many iterations in a short period of time without wasting too much filament.

If you see that there still is no improvement you can stop the print and start a new one. It will be at the point again quickly where the two pyramids print, so you can observe the stringing behavior. The height of the base plate is only 0.7mm (3 small layers if you print with 0.3mm for the first layer and 0.2mm for the following layers).

I measured a weight of 0.23g for a finished print of one of these in PLA.

If tuning the retraction and temperature settings doesn't help, try drying your filament and make sure there is no overextrusion before you print another 20 of these things.
